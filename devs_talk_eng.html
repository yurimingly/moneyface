 <h2>What a day!! Hi! This is developer Horuru.</h2>
 <h4>I created a service to see if I resemble a currency person of the country and how much my face is.</h4><br><br>
 
 Are you struggling with various situations these days that are difficult with corona?<br>
 So I made it with the mind that I wish you could laugh through a funny things.<br><br>
 
 The first criterion for selecting a person of currency was to be based on Asians.<br>
 So I tried to make it based on East Asian paper money greats,<br>
 but major East Asian countries used the same person in several bank notes (ex. China, Vietnam).<br><br>
 
 Thus, based on Korea, the United States and Japan,<br>
 the banknotes for which the result value will be selected were selected.<br>
 The United States is a country that has a lot of influence around the world,<br>
 so I chose the dollar because everyone knows it.<br>
 
 I selected the face photos of celebrities that look similar to currency figures and machine learned for 5-600 photos.<br>
 From now on,<br>
 let's take a look at which people from which country have been selected as banknotes and their achievements?<br><br><br>

He is one of the six prefectures who simultaneously engaged in literacy and orientation with Jongmyo Lee, Lee Eon-jeok, Lee Lee, Song Si-yeol, Park Se-chae, and Kim Ji-ip.<br>
He worked hard on the establishment of the seowon and the training of successors,<br>
and some of his writings were looted by Japanese troops during the Imjin War, which also influenced the development of Japanese Confucianism.<br><br>

It was developed into Korean by Ju Si-gyeong in the 20th century, and is widely used as an official character in Korea today.<br>
